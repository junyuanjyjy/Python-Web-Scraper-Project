# Web-Scraper-CS50-Final-Project


Project Name: Morning Briefing

Background: As a treasury professional, I conduct a briefing every morning to traders explaining events happening in the market.
I have to search for 4 key data points and its movements which are S&P500, USDMYR,US 10 Year Treasury Yield and FBMKLCI. 
I then have to explain some key market news happening last night. 

Description:The web app that I created have 2 functionalities. First is the up-to date data of the four key data points and its movements.
Secondly, I have the news tab with the latest headlines of a local business newspaper called The Edge. Clicking into the article title would
allow user to access the article.
